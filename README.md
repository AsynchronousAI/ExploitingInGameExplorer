# ORIGINAL README:
This is a game explorer and properties window for in-game debugging purposes
It is only intended to be used for developers of an experience

## Setup Instructions:
1. Drag InGameExplorer script to ServerScriptService
2. Set up Permissions and Keybind modules to what you desire

There's a plugin in here too which you can use to import properties and attributes of changed things in-game back to studio
Save ImportPropertiesPlugin as a local plugin if you want to use this

Feel free to tweak as needed, and report any bugs to me(tyridge77#5390 on discord or https://twitter.com/rblx_tyridge77).
